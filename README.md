# School_District_Analysis
Module 4 Work

## Project Overview
A school district has asked for a comprehensive analysis of the schools in their district. The deliverables should include a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics and an overview of the key metrics for each school, all presented in a table format. 

The School Board asked for the following key metrics:
	1.) Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
	2.) The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
	3.)  The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
	4.)  School performance based on the budget per student
	5.)  School performance based on the school size 
	6.)  School performance based on the type of school
